use controller 3 as workspace for the exercises

1. create a form for inputting information of a user. includes:
    first name
    last name
    email

    *all entries are required
    *email must have valid format

2. when the form is submitted, check for validity.
    *emails should be UNIQUE
    *combination of first name & last name must be UNIQUE

    display an error message when submission failed

    if success, add a property 'date created' to the user object. format is year/month/day. then display a success message
    *you can use angular's $filter service for formatting the date. search it up

3. create a table that will display all inputted users' information. include headers
    *arrangement of columns is up to you

4. for each user in the table, create a delete button at the last column. when clicked, prompt if the user will be deleted
    *you may use javascript's confirm()

*you may use any approach. make it as efficient/short as possible. research is key
